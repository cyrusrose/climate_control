Climate Control System is a project to allow collecting and processing data from the climate control system. 
The current stage is `development`. This repository lacks `google-services.json` file, hence you've got to use your own.

In this branch you'll find:
* User Interface built with **Views** and **[Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding)**.
* A single-activity architecture, using **[Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started)**
  and **[Safe Args](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-pass-data)**.
* A **UI layer** that contains a **View** and **[ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)**.
* Reactive UIs using **[Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)** and **[Coroutine](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html)** 
  for asynchronous operations.
* A **data layer** with a repository and Firebase **[Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/android/start)**.
* A **Coil library** for fetching images from Firebase **[Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/android/start)**.
